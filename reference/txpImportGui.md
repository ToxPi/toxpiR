# Import data file generated by ToxPi GUI

Import data file generated by ToxPi GUI

## Usage

``` r
txpImportGui(guiDataFile)
```

## Arguments

- guiDataFile:

  Character scalar, the path to a 'data' export from the ToxPi GUI

## Value

`list` with `$model` containing
[TxpModel](https://toxpi.github.io/toxpiR/reference/TxpModel-class.md)
object; `$input` containing `data.frame` with input data; `$fills`
containing a vector of fill colors.

## Details

This function takes the '\_data.csv' files generated by the GUI. See
<https://toxpi.org> for more information.

Because of the way toxpiR implements transformation functions, there is
not a way currently to use the GUI 'hitcount' function.
